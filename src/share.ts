// A link that opens your setup in someone else's Bench: the output and the board driving it, the
// parts you put on the bench, what each of the app's controls is connected to, and the app (a
// bundled one by its id, your own as its code). Share stores the setup on Bench's server and gives
// a short link, /s/<id>, that fits anywhere a link goes (LinkedIn caps a whole post at 3,000
// characters). If it can't be stored, Share gives the long link, which carries the setup itself
// after #share= (src/share-format.js) and never reaches a server.
//
// Opening a link writes the setup where Bench keeps its own (localStorage, read on start) before
// the first render. What it replaces is kept until you choose: the note saying a link was opened
// comes back on every load until you go back to your bench or keep this one.
