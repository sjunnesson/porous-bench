Adafruit\'s GC9A01A driver works as it is (its init, BGR order, INVON); RGB565 pixels go out big-endian.',
    'Rotation 0 (Adafruit\'s) is up with the XIAO\'s USB-C on the right, as Seeed holds it, and the touch panel reports in the same pixels. Bench\'s firmware turns it 270° (rotation 3, SCREEN_ROTATION in platformio.ini) for a USB-C facing down, and turns the touch points with it.',

    'The power switch on the rim cuts the display board\'s 3.3 V even on USB: switched off, the screen stays dark and the I2C bus loses its pull-ups, so an I2C scan without a timeout hangs.',

It doesn\'t answer while idle. While touched, INT (D7) pulses ~72 times a second, low most of the time: latch its falling edges by interrupt and read after one, or while INT is low or a finger was down. Expose it as Bench\'s `touchscreen` module and `touch_*` events.',
