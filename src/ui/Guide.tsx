            dashboard, a lamp that reacts to the room. You start with an example running in your browser, make it
            your own, put it on a real board and change the parts around it. You don't need to know electronics or
            programming. Claude writes the code; you decide what it should do and check that it does.

                One short file of code in a language called Lua, ending in <code>.lua</code>. It draws on the output and

          <Step n={1}>
            <p>
              <a href="/">Open Bench</a>. It starts on an example called <Ui>Porous systems</Ui>: a logo drawing itself on a
              square touch screen, sitting on a desk next to a knob, a slider and a button. The page has three columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Left, the app:</strong> which app runs (<Ui>App</Ui>), its code (<Ui>Code</Ui>), the ways apps
                arrive from outside, and the <Ui>Console</Ui>, where the app's messages and errors appear.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Middle, the desk:</strong> the device and its parts. <Ui>3D</Ui>, <Ui>Flat</Ui> and <Ui>Wiring</Ui>{' '}
                above it switch between a 3D model, the bare screen pixel for pixel, and a wiring diagram.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Right, the hardware:</strong> the <Ui>Output</Ui> the app draws on, the <Ui>Inputs</Ui> on the
                desk, and the <Ui>Connections</Ui> between them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now play with it:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Turn the knob: drag its ring on the desk, or press <Key>←</Key> and <Key>→</Key>. The hollow spoke in the
                logo moves round.
              </li>
              <li>Click the button on the desk (Button 1). It stamps a spoke where the hollow one is.</li>
              <li>Drag the slider. The background runs from black through the colours to white.</li>
              <li>
                Press <Key>A</Key> to start the logo again (on a touch screen, a click on the screen does too).
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Then open the <Ui>App</Ui> menu and try a few others: <Ui>Hello display</Ui> shows facts about the screen and
              a bouncing ball, <Ui>Knob menu</Ui> is a settings menu you drive with the knob. The menu lists only the apps
              that can run on this output; the rest are greyed out at the bottom, each with the reason.
            </p>

            <h3>Change something</h3>
            <p>
              The <Ui>Code</Ui> panel shows the app's code. You don't need to understand it to change it. In{' '}
              <Ui>Hello display</Ui>, look for a number or a colour (colours look like <code>0xFF8800</code>: red, green and
              blue as two characters each), change it, and press <Ui>Run ⌘↵</Ui> (or <Key>⌘</Key> <Key>Enter</Key>,{' '}
              <Key>Ctrl</Key> <Key>Enter</Key> on Windows). The app restarts with your change.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you break it, the screen stops and the <Ui>Console</Ui> says what went wrong and on which line. Pick the
              app again from the <Ui>App</Ui> menu to get the original back.
            </p>
            <Check>
              your change on the screen, and "Hello display (edited)" in the <Ui>App</Ui> menu.
            </Check>
            <p className="guide-aside">
              Along the top, <Ui>↻ Restart</Ui> starts the app from the beginning and <Ui>❚❚ Pause</Ui> freezes time, with{' '}
              <Ui>Step</Ui> to move a frame at a time. Everything you set up is saved in this browser and is there next time.
            </p>
          </Step>

          <Step n={2}>
            <p>
              Examples are for learning. For your own idea, describe it to Claude and let it write the app. Bench copies
              Claude everything it needs to know: the output, the parts on your desk, how Resident apps work and how to send
              the result back. There are two ways for the app to reach Bench; start with the first.
            </p>

            <h3>Set up Claude Code once</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Install <Out href="https://claude.com/claude-code">Claude Code</Out> and start it in a terminal with{' '}
                <code>claude</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add Resident's plugin, which teaches Claude how Resident apps work. Type these into Claude Code:
                <pre>
                  <code>{'/plugin marketplace add inanimate-tech/agent-plugins\n/plugin install resident@inanimate'}</code>
                </pre>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The simple way: a folder Bench watches</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Make a new, empty folder for your project, for example <code>my-device</code> in your Documents.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Bench, under <Ui>Receive apps</Ui>, press <Ui>Watch a folder for apps</Ui> and pick that folder. The browser
                asks whether Bench may edit it: say yes, so Bench can put a file there that tells Claude about this Bench (
                <code>DEVICE-SKILL.md</code>).
              </li>
              <li>
                Open a terminal in the same folder and start <code>claude</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Bench's <Ui>App</Ui> panel, press <Ui>Copy a prompt for Claude</Ui>, paste it into Claude Code and add a
                sentence or two about your idea. Be concrete about what each part should do:
                <blockquote>
                  A kitchen timer. Turning the knob sets the minutes, the button starts and pauses it, and when it reaches
                  zero the screen flashes.
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Claude writes the app and saves it in the folder. Bench runs it the moment it's saved.</li>
            </ol>
            <Check>
              the new app on Bench's screen, and "Running …" with its file name under <Ui>Receive apps</Ui>.
            </Check>
            <p>
              Now keep talking to Claude: "make the numbers bigger", "count down in seconds for the last minute", "it
              crashes when I turn the knob below zero". Each time it saves, Bench runs the new version. When something's
              wrong, tell Claude what you see, and paste what the <Ui>Console</Ui> says.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a reload, the browser asks again before Bench can read the folder: press{' '}
              <span className="ui">Resume watching …</span> under <Ui>Receive apps</Ui>.
            </p>

            <h3>The other way: over the relay</h3>
            <p>
              Bench can also join Resident's relay and receive apps exactly as a real board does. Under{' '}
              <Ui>Receive apps</Ui>, press <Ui>Connect</Ui>; when it says online, <Ui>Copy push-app</Ui> copies a command with
              this Bench's device ID. Paste it into Claude Code and follow it with your idea. Use this when you work from
              another computer, or want to see the exact path an app takes to a board. Claude Code may ask before sending a
              file to an outside server; the folder needs no such permission.
            </p>

            <h3>Or start from the parts yourself</h3>
            <p>
              <Ui>Start from my bench</Ui>, also under <Ui>App</Ui>, writes an app with every part on your desk already
              connected and shown live on the screen. It's a skeleton: useful if you'd like to edit code yourself, or to
              check that each part does what you expect.
            </p>
          </Step>

          <Step n={3}>
            <p>
              When the app does what you want on Bench, put it on real hardware. This happens once per board: install
              Resident on it, connect it to your Wi-Fi, and from then on Bench can send it any app.
            </p>

            <h3>Choose a board</h3>
            <p>
              The easiest are the boards that already have firmware tested on them (Bench's own, or Resident's for the
              M5Sticks). Each has its screen built in or comes as a pair, so there is nothing to wire:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 (a narrow colour screen)</li>
              <li>Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2 (a 2″ colour touch screen, with a motion sensor)</li>
              <li>Seeed Studio Round Display for XIAO with a XIAO ESP32S3 plugged in behind it (a round colour touch screen)</li>
              <li>Waveshare 2.13″ e-Paper on the Waveshare ESP32 e-Paper Driver Board (black and white, readable in daylight, slow to change)</li>
              <li>M5StickC Plus2 or M5StickS3 (a small screen in a case, with buttons)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Any other display or LED strip in Bench works too: Claude builds firmware for it step by step, checking each
              stage with you on the real board. That takes longer and some back and forth, so it's a good second project.
            </p>

            <h3>Install Resident on it</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                In Bench's <Ui>Output</Ui>, choose the display you have (and, for a bare display or LEDs, the board under it).
              </li>
              <li>
                Under <Ui>Real device</Ui>, press <Ui>Copy a prompt to set up a board</Ui>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make another empty folder, start <code>claude</code> in it and paste the prompt. Claude installs PlatformIO
                (the tool that builds and flashes ESP32 software) if you don't have it, and builds the firmware.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plug the board in. Claude finds it and asks you to confirm before flashing, because flashing replaces
                whatever was on it. If the board doesn't show up, try another cable, or hold its BOOT button while you plug
                it in.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Get it online</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                After flashing, the board opens a Wi-Fi network of its own, named "Resident …". Join it from your phone; a
                page opens where you pick your home Wi-Fi and type its password. ESP32 boards only use 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.
              </li>
              <li>The board joins your Wi-Fi, connects to the relay and shows its device ID on the screen (Claude reads it out too).</li>
              <li>
                In Bench, under <Ui>Real device</Ui>, type the ID and press <Ui>Mirror</Ui>.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <Check>
              "mirroring" next to <Ui>Real device</Ui>, and your app on the board a moment later. Turn the knob in Bench and the
              real screen follows.
            </Check>
            <p>
              That's <em>mirroring</em>: the board runs the app itself, and Bench feeds it the inputs. So you don't need any
              real knobs or sensors yet: the ones on Bench's desk drive the board. <Key>A</Key> and <Key>B</Key> on Bench
              reach the board too, and its own buttons and touch screen keep working; Bench doesn't see those presses,
              so after one the two screens can differ. Pick
              another app in Bench and the board switches to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <Ui>Stop</Ui> ends mirroring; the board keeps running the app with the last values it got. Next time, the board
              is in a menu under <Ui>Real device</Ui>, so you don't have to type its ID again.
            </p>
          </Step>

          <Step n={4}>
            <p>
              Designing is mostly trying things: a bigger screen, a second button, a sensor instead of a knob. On Bench each
              of those is a click, and you can see whether the app still makes sense before buying anything.
            </p>

            <h3>The output</h3>
            <p>
              In <Ui>Output</Ui>, the first menu chooses a display, an <Ui>LED strip</Ui>, an <Ui>LED ring</Ui> or an{' '}
              <Ui>LED matrix</Ui>; the next one which display, or how many LEDs. For a bare display or LEDs, a third menu
              picks the board that drives it. Under them, Bench lists what that board can run: its drawing libraries and how
              much memory an app gets. The <Ui>App</Ui> menu then shows only the apps that fit.
            </p>
            <p>
              An app written for one screen often runs on another, but a layout made for a wide screen may not fit a narrow
              one. Switch, look, and ask Claude to adapt it ("make it work on the 128×64 OLED too").
            </p>

            <h3>The inputs</h3>
            <p>
              In <Ui>Inputs</Ui>, <Ui>+ Add an input…</Ui> puts a part on the desk: a push button, a switch (a toggle, or a
              reed switch that a magnet on a door closes), a rotary encoder, a slide pot, a joystick, a touch pad, a 12-key
              keypad, an IR receiver with its remote, an RFID reader with its cards, an IMU (senses tilt and shaking), a
              microphone (hears how loud it is, and claps), an LD2410 radar (senses someone standing still nearby), a distance
              sensor (how far a hand is), a thermal camera (sees warm things, 8×8 pixels), a PIR (senses movement), a light
              sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor, a CO₂ sensor (how stale the air is), a pulse sensor (a fingertip's
              heartbeat), or a buzzer. Each one gets a control in the panel and a model on the desk, wired to the board.{' '}
              <Ui>remove</Ui> takes one away. Parts marked <Ui>built-in</Ui> are part of the board itself. The microphone can
              listen to this computer's own mic, and a gamepad plugged in moves the joystick.
            </p>

            <h3>The connections</h3>
            <p>
              An app doesn't ask for "the encoder on pin 4". It asks for what it needs: a <em>dial</em> called "minutes" (a
              value to turn up and down) or a <em>trigger</em> called "start" (something that happens). <Ui>Connections</Ui>{' '}
              lists them, and for each one you choose which part drives it:
            </p>
            <table className="guide-table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>The app asks for</th>
                  <th>Any of these can drive it</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>a dial: a number in a range</td>
                  <td>
                    turning an encoder, a slide pot, the joystick, tilting the IMU, the radar's or the distance sensor's
                    distance, where something warm is, light level, how loud it is, temperature, humidity, CO₂, heart rate
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>a trigger: a moment</td>
                  <td>
                    a button press, a switch turned on, pushing the encoder or the joystick, a touch, a key on the keypad or
                    the remote, a card on the reader, shaking the IMU, the radar seeing someone, a hand coming near, PIR motion,
                    the room going dark, a clap, the air getting stuffy, a heartbeat
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
              So the kitchen timer's "minutes" could be the knob today and a tilt of the device tomorrow, with no change to
              the code. If the part you want isn't on the desk, the same menu offers to add it. <Ui>Keyboard only</Ui> leaves a
              control on its keys. Bench remembers your choice for each app.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a new part should do something new ("dim the screen when the room gets dark"), press{' '}
              <Ui>Copy a prompt for Claude</Ui> again so Claude sees the new desk, or just tell it what you added.
            </p>
            <Check>
              the value next to each dial in <Ui>Connections</Ui> change as you move its part. If you're mirroring, the real
              board reacts to the new parts as well.
            </Check>
          </Step>

          <Step n={5}>
            <p>
              Mirroring needs Bench open. For a device that works on its own, wire the real parts to the board and have them
              read by its firmware.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Press <Ui>Wiring</Ui> above the desk. Bench draws the board, the power rails and each part, with every wire
                labelled at both ends: which pin on the part goes to which pin on the board. Under the diagram is a list of
                what to check before you power up. <Ui>Save diagram</Ui> downloads it to print.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unplug the board, then wire it as drawn, with jumper wires and a breadboard. Before plugging it back in,
                compare the pins with your board's own pinout: Bench's pins come from datasheets and can be wrong.
              </li>
              <li>
                Press <Ui>Copy a prompt to set up a board</Ui> again. It now lists your parts and their pins. Paste it into
                Claude Code and say that you want the real parts to work on their own; Claude adds them to the firmware and
                flashes it again.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="guide-aside">
              Unplug before changing any wire. Power each part from the pin the diagram shows (3V3 or 5V), and never join a
              power pin straight to GND: either can damage the board.
            </p>
