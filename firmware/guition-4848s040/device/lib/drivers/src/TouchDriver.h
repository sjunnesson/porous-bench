// `touchscreen`: the GT911 touch panel (I2C 0x5D), one finger, as Bench's
// touchscreen module. It reports in panel pixels (0-479), turned into the
// ones apps draw in when SCREEN_ROTATION turns the picture: stage 1 draws a
// crosshair at the reported point to check.
//
//   touchscreen.read()     -> { pressed = bool, x, y }: the last point touched
//   touchscreen.pressed()  -> bool
//
// Driver events, e.data = { x, y }: touch_down, touch_move (the newest point,
// at most once a loop, only when it moved), touch_up, and touch_tap after
// touch_up for a release within 500 ms that moved under 10 px.
//
// INT and RST aren't wired, so the chip is polled every 10 ms: its status
// register says whether a new report is ready and how many fingers it holds.
//
// The board has no key an app can use, so the touch panel is also Resident's
// system button: during the boot countdown, a touch anywhere loads the saved
// app now and a long one forgets it.
