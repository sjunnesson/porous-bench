# Resident on the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2

Firmware that puts the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2 on Resident's relay, so porous.systems Bench
can mirror apps onto it. One PlatformIO project per stage of Resident's start-building guide, each
buildable on its own; Resident is pinned by commit (0.12.0, `5ca238c`; stage 3 on Bench's fork at `4220083`, which adds the tick interval and the event drain), so nothing needs cloning.

```
device-no-resident/       stage 1: chip info, a test card, I2C scan, touch crosshair
device-minimal-resident/  stage 2: Wi-Fi portal, WebSocket to the relay, status and device ID
device/                   stage 3: the drivers; DEVICE-SKILL.md and check apps in device-apps/
```

Build and flash a stage with `pio run -t upload` in its folder. The board shows up as a USB
Serial/JTAG port (`/dev/cu.usbmodem…`); if it doesn't, hold BOOT while pressing RST.

## What stage 3 gives apps

`screen` (M5Stick verbs), `lgfx` (LovyanGFX-style), `lvgl` (LVGL 9 via luavgl), `button` (BOOT:
`tap` / `hold`), `touchscreen` (CST816D: `read()`, `touch_*` events), `imu` (QMI8658), `screens`
(`"main"`: 240×320, 16-bit, dark, brightness). Lua and LVGL live in the 8 MB PSRAM. Bench's board
entry (`waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-lcd-2`: screen, lgfx, lvgl, 8192 KB) matches: with LVGL bound and an
app running, ~8.1 MB of PSRAM and ~204 KB of internal RAM stay free (measured).

Brought up and tested on hardware 2026-10-12: device type `s3-lcd2`, firmware `s3-lcd2-0.1`.

## What bring-up taught

- **Staying online:** joined to a distant access point at -93 dBm (the near one reads -77 to -82),
  every relay connect timed out, and Courier gave up after 10 attempts until a reboot. Courier has
  two such dead ends (giving up, and a setup portal with no timeout when Wi-Fi drops mid-reconnect);
  `keepConnecting()` in `main.cpp` reconnects out of the first and reboots out of the second when
  the board was online earlier. The `[heartbeat]` line prints the signal, channel and access point:
  read it first when the board drops off. Opening the serial port resets the board.
- **Chip:** ESP32-S3 (QFN56) rev v0.2, 8 MB embedded octal PSRAM (`qio_opi`), 16 MB flash, on
  espressif32@6.12.0 (Arduino core 2.0.17). Native USB only: `ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1` and
  `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1`, or Serial stays silent.
- **Panel:** Adafruit's ST7789 driver at `init(240, 320)` sends SWRESET (the LCD's reset isn't wired,
  so the pin is -1) and INVON, with no RAM offset. Rotation 2 (MADCTL 0x00) is the panel's native
  scan: USB-C at the bottom. Colours, edges and orientation checked on a test card.
- **The frame:** `screen`, `lgfx`, LVGL and the status text share one 240×320 RGB565 canvas (150 KB,
  in PSRAM). Adafruit's driver pushed a full frame in ~25 ms, blocking; stage 3 uses ESP-IDF's
  pushes only what changed instead (see "Speed" below).
- **Backlight:** GPIO1, PWM at 10 kHz, 10-bit, as Waveshare runs it; dark until driven.
- **I2C (SDA 48, SCL 47, 400 kHz):** touch at 0x15, IMU at 0x6B, and an unlisted device at 0x7E
  that nothing here uses.
- **Touch (CST816D, chip ID 0xB6):** polled every 10 ms, INT and RST unused. Its coordinates are the
  picture's: a crosshair drawn at the reported point sits under the finger.
- **IMU (QMI8658):** reads the first samples as zeros right after it's turned on (wait ~80 ms). Its
  axes don't line up with the screen's: face-up it reads z = -1 g, the right edge tipped down reads
  chip -y and the bottom edge chip +x, so x and y swap as well as change sign. A first fix that only
  flipped signs looked right for diagonal tilts and was wrong; `device-apps/imu-check.lua` walks
  through each tilt and a turn and logs what the IMU saw, which settled it. Bench's frame (x right,
  y down the screen, z out of it) is mirror-image to the chip's, so the gyro gets its own mapping
  (`ImuDriver.cpp`): gx is the rate the bottom edge tips down, gy minus the rate the right edge does
  (as Bench's `imu.ts`), gz positive turning counter-clockwise seen from above. The gyro drifts a few
  °/s at rest (-4 on one axis): the driver averages half a second at boot and subtracts it, so keep
  the board still while it starts. Lying on a desk it reads ~0.06 g of tilt, so a tilt-ball app's
  ball drifts slowly to an edge where Bench's would sit still.
- **LVGL timers outlived their app.** Resident keeps one Lua state for as long as the board runs, and
  on 0.10.2 an app reset deleted the old app's objects but not its `lvgl.Timer`s. Mirroring the
  flame a second time left the first one's 30 fps timer calling into deleted objects ("expect lua
  lvgl object, got null", which luavgl draws as a box on the screen, not on serial) and holding its
  memory. We reported it (inanimate-tech/resident#61) and ran our own timer reaper until Resident
  0.12.0 fixed it: app reset now calls `luavgl_app_reset` from Inanimate's luavgl fork, which frees
  the old app's timers, anims, top-layer objects and styles. 0.12.0 needs that fork at `b982422` or
  later, or the board won't link. Checked here on 2026-10-21 with the issue's probes: a timer stops
  when the next app loads, even one from an app that failed to load; the top layer comes back
  empty; an anim with no `exec_cb` fails its load ("anim has no exec_cb") where the old luavgl
  aborted the board. Bench runs each app in a fresh Lua state, so the browser never showed it.
- **Saved apps outgrew NVS.** Resident keeps the last app that loaded cleanly, for the next boot, as
  an NVS blob by default. NVS here is 20 KB and also holds Wi-Fi and the `store` module, so a 17.6 KB
  app failed to save (`persist_too_big`, nothing on screen) and a reboot brought back an older,
  smaller one. `AppStore.h` keeps the app as `/app.lua` on the 12 MB LittleFS partition instead
  (formatted on first boot, Wi-Fi untouched), logging `[store] app saved/loaded: N bytes`.
- **Battery:** GPIO5 (ADC1 channel 4) through a divider; stage 1 shows the pin's millivolts, and
  there's no driver for it.
- **Wi-Fi:** the factory firmware left a saved network (`WSTEST`); WiFiManager tried it for 20 s, then
  opened the `Resident S3-lcd2 <id>` portal.
- **Device ID:** `b4df8785` (from the MAC, 28:84:85:87:DF:B4).

## Speed: the flame from 3.4 to 29 fps

Mirroring `my-apps/flame.lua` (then 34 LVGL ovals, gradients, shadows and a translucent glow) ran
at 3.4 fps here against 30 on Bench. Measured over serial with a frame counter in the app and the
firmware's `[perf]` line (pushes a second, rows a push, push time, loop time):

| Change | fps |
|---|---|
| Start: 34 ovals, shadows, 6-oval glow; every LVGL frame pushed the whole 150 KB canvas | 3.4 |
| App: integer colour blends, fewer ovals, colours sent only when they change, no shadows | 5.5 |
| Firmware: LVGL's draw buffer in internal RAM (80 rows, was 32 in PSRAM); each flush pushes only its rectangle | 6.7 |
| App: glow and room follow the steady light, not each flicker | 10.9 |
| Firmware: `-O2` instead of `-Os` | 12.5 |
| Firmware: LVGL circle cache 32, style cache on | 12.9 |
| App: the glow opaque, its see-through look worked out in advance | 18.9, but 16 ovals looked lumpy; 25 smooth ones: 12 |
| App: drawn row by row with lgfx (the C6 flame's renderer), driven by an `lvgl.Timer` | 20 |
| Firmware: lgfx/screen flips push only the rows drawn; app: redraws only rows near the flame | 23 |
| App: per row, repaints only where the flame was last frame and isn't now | **28** (~30 ms a frame) |

What it taught:
- **An LVGL `:set` costs 0.2-0.65 ms here** (four properties ~0.43 ms), mostly style refresh and
  invalidation, so 25 moving ovals are ~25 ms of Lua before anything is drawn.
- **LVGL repaints everything under whatever changed.** Three big translucent glow ovals under the
  flame cost ~20 ms a frame even when they didn't move; opaque ones with the blend precomputed cost
  ~1 ms. A full-screen gradient background costs little; translucency is the expensive part.
- **Two LVGL draw threads (`LV_USE_OS` FreeRTOS, `LV_DRAW_SW_DRAW_UNIT_CNT 2`) gained nothing**, so
  they're off.
- **For many moving shapes, lgfx rows beat LVGL objects**: no per-object cost, and with the canvas
  remembering drawn rows, a flip pushes only those. An app gets LVGL's 30 fps timer by binding LVGL
  first and lgfx last (the last bind owns the screen; Resident and Bench keep running LVGL timers).
- **A DMA push in the background (ESP-IDF esp_lcd) left the screen black** on this panel, though
  the transfers completed; it measured a full flip at ~15 ms against Adafruit's 25. Pushing only
  what changed mattered more: with the flame's ~160 rows a frame, the blocking Adafruit push keeps
  28 fps too. The esp_lcd attempt is not in the tree; its likely gap is the panel init (esp_lcd's
  ST7789 sequence, not Adafruit's), worth a test at 40 MHz before trying again.
- **LVGL refreshes every 15 ms, and fonts aren't compressed** (since 2026-10-23, `lv_conf.h`).
  `LV_DEF_REFR_PERIOD` was 33, which held LVGL to 30 frames a second however fast it drew. Resident
  runs LVGL's timers at most every 5 ms (`lv_timer_handler_run_in_period(5)`), so the period should
  be a multiple of 5: 16 only came due at 20 ms (50 fps), 15 gives up to ~66. `LV_USE_FONT_COMPRESSED` is off, so no glyph is decompressed as it's drawn; the
  one compressed built-in font, `MONTSERRAT_28_COMPRESSED`, is off with it (plain `MONTSERRAT_28`
  stays). Flash 2,564,069 → 2,537,625 bytes. Measured on the board, with two LVGL apps whose
  timer moves something every millisecond: a 48 px box crossing the screen went from 28.6 to 65.6
  fps (0.8 ms a push), and the whole screen changing colour each frame from 27.8 to 31.1 fps, where
  the 20 ms push of 320 rows is now the limit. `lvgl-check.lua` loads and runs as before.
- **`on_tick` every 33 ms, not 100** (since 2026-10-23): `SandboxConfig::tickIntervalMs = 33`, a
  field on Bench's Resident fork (`sjunnesson/resident`, 0.12.0 plus the field) until
  inanimate-tech/resident takes it. Measured on the C6-LCD-1.47 (a 65 ms flame went from 10 to 15
  fps); not yet on this board. Bench's profile for the display ticks at 33 too (`tickMs`).
- **Doubles are software on the S3** (its FPU is single precision), as on the C6: blend colours in
  integers, build tables once, precompute per-object constants.

## Home Assistant (optional)

With `device/src/HomeAssistantConfig.h` (gitignored; copy `HomeAssistantConfig.example.h`), every
`events.send` also goes as an HTTP POST to a Home Assistant webhook on the LAN, so an app can
switch lights with nothing in the cloud listening: the relay takes the board's events but passes
them to no one. The body is the event as the relay gets it (`{"channel":"app","type":"lamp",
"data":{"on":false,...},"from":"b4df8785",...}`), read in an automation as `trigger.json`. Use the
Pi's IP address (the board doesn't resolve `.local`), and keep the webhook ID out of git: it is the
only thing guarding the hook. The POST runs on its own task, so a slow or absent Home Assistant
never stalls the app. Without the file the firmware is unchanged.

An automation for La Linea (`my-apps/la-linea.lua`, which sends `lamp` `{on, level}`):

```yaml
alias: La Linea switches the room
triggers:
  - trigger: webhook
    webhook_id: <the ID in HomeAssistantConfig.h>
    allowed_methods: [POST]
    local_only: true
conditions:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.json.type == 'lamp' }}"
actions:
  - action: "light.turn_{{ 'on' if trigger.json.data.on else 'off' }}"
    target:
      area_id: <the room's area ID>
mode: queued
```

## Check apps (device/device-apps/)

- `driver-check.lua`: accel, gyro, temperature, touch and its events, BOOT taps and holds, the
  screen verbs, and a ball that rolls downhill; logs the accelerometer once a second.
- `lvgl-check.lua`: an LVGL arc following the x tilt, a sliding box, a label counting BOOT taps.
- `imu-check.lua`: a guided check (flat, right edge down, bottom edge down, a quarter turn left)
  that logs the accelerometer and the gyro's total turn for each step.
