# porous.systems Bench (Resident simulator board)

Bench is a browser simulator that runs Resident apps on a choice of virtual displays. Its board
surface is the M5StickC Plus2's (`screen`, `imu`, `buzzer`, `button`, two buttons) plus `lgfx`, on
whichever display the user has selected, plus three Bench drivers for hardware on its desk (`dial`,
`trigger`, `ld2410`). Apps written for the M5Stick run unchanged; apps that read
`screens.get("main")` adapt to every display.

Pass this file to the Resident plugin: `/resident:create-app --device-skill docs/resident/DEVICE-SKILL.md …`

## Hardware

**Screen** `"main"`: the selected display. Ask for its facts, never assume them:

```lua
local s = screens.get("main")   -- { name, w, h, shape, depth = 16 | 1, scheme = "dark" | "light", dpi?, brightness,
                                --   model, controller, tech = "lcd" | "amoled" | "oled" | "epaper" }  (the last three are Bench extras)
```

| Display | Size seen by apps | depth | scheme | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M5StickC Plus2 / M5StickS3 | 240×135 (landscape) | 16 | dark | the default Resident board |
| Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 | 172×320 | 16 | dark | rounded corners: keep ~20 px clear |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.32 | 466×466 | 16 | dark | round (`shape = "round"`): only the circle of radius 233 shows; AMOLED, black is off; touch panel (`touchscreen`) |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-AMOLED-1.91 | 536×240 (landscape) | 16 | dark | AMOLED, black is off; IMU; the Touch version adds a touch panel (`touchscreen`) |
| 1.3" ST7789 | 240×240 | 16 | dark | |
| SSD1306 OLED | 128×64 or 128×32 | 1 | dark | colours threshold to lit/unlit at 50% brightness |
| 2.13" e-paper | 122×250 | 1 | light | every `flip()` is a refresh (0.3 s partial, 2 s full every 10th); it runs in the background and only the newest frame reaches the glass: flip only when something changed |

On 1-bit screens use pure white for marks on a dark scheme, pure black on a light one.

**Buttons**: two, indices 0 (key A) and 1 (key B). Gestures arrive in `on_event`: `tap`
(`e.data.index`, `e.data.count`) on a release before 500 ms, `hold` (`e.data.held = true` at 500 ms,
`false` on release). A legacy `button` event fires alongside `tap`.

**IMU**: 6-axis, body frame. At rest face-up `imu.accel()` ≈ `(0, 0, 1)` g; the user tilts it with a
pad and can shake it. `imu.gyro()` in °/s. `imu.temp()` returns 0.

**Buzzer**: square-wave piezo, 20–20000 Hz (clamped), durations up to 5000 ms.

## Which outputs list an app

Bench lists an app only for outputs, and boards, that can run it. Say what the code can't show in
the header:

```lua
-- Tilt ball: roll a ball with the IMU   -- line 1: "Name: description"
-- @output display                       -- display (the default) | strip (strips and rings) | matrix
-- @needs motion color touch 240x135     -- only the ones that apply
```

- `@output`: an app that names its output and arrives (pushed, dropped or run) while Bench shows
  another kind switches Bench to that kind: a matrix app pushed at a display gets the LED matrix.
- `motion`: it animates (so not e-paper). `color`: it means nothing in 1-bit. `touch`: it needs a
  touch panel. `WxH`: the smallest screen, as apps see it, that its fixed layout fits. An app that adapts through `screens.get`
  needs none of these.
- Bench reads the rest from the code: the libraries it binds (`lvgl.bind` needs a board with LVGL)
  and its size (the memory it takes on a real board).

## Boards: libraries and memory

The board driving the output decides what an app gets. Bench shows it under the display, with a
**Board** menu for bare modules and LEDs:

| Board | Libraries | Memory for apps |
|---|---|---|
| M5StickC Plus2, M5StickS3, ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 N16R8, Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.32, Waveshare ESP32-S3-(Touch-)AMOLED-1.91 | `screen`, `lgfx`, `lvgl` | PSRAM (MBs) |
| ESP32 without PSRAM (Waveshare ESP32 e-Paper Driver Board, ESP32 DevKitC) | `screen`, `lgfx`; no `lvgl` | ~70 KB |
| Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 | `screen`, `lgfx`, `lvgl` | not measured yet |

On a board without PSRAM, draw with `lgfx` (or `screen`) and keep the app small: receiving and
compiling it takes about 6x its size, so stay under ~6 KB of Lua, and `datetime` costs ~35 KB
once touched.

## On a real board (Bench's Mirror)

Bench's Real device panel pushes the open app to a Resident device and drives it from the bench:

- The app travels wrapped in a small shim (only the stand-ins it uses, minified) that defines
  `dial`, `trigger`, `light`, `pir`, `climate`, `touch`, `ld2410`, `imu` and a silent `buzzer` where
  the firmware has none, fed by `bench` events from Bench. Write against the API and it runs
  unchanged.
- Buttons A and B: the taps and holds Bench recognises are replayed on the board, and the board's
  own keys are ignored while Bench mirrors, so both screens count the same. `button.press_count()`
  counts Bench's taps. Touches on Bench's screen are replayed the same way, in order with their
  points, and the board's own touch panel is ignored while Bench mirrors.
- E-paper: the real panel refreshes in the background, newest frame wins, exactly as Bench shows it.
- An app the board can't load (out of memory, a module it lacks) leaves the previous app on screen:
  Bench only knows the relay took it. The Board line in Bench tells you what fits.

## Lua modules

### lgfx (preferred)

```lua
local g = lgfx.bind("main")
g:fillScreen(0x000000)
g:setTextColor(0xFFFFFF); g:setTextSize(2); g:setTextDatum(lgfx.MC_DATUM)
g:drawString("hi", g:width() // 2, g:height() // 2)
g:flip()                          -- nothing is visible until flip
```

Full sheet: Resident's `prompts/lgfx.md`. Integer arguments are checked like `luaL_checkinteger`:
`g:fillRect(1.5, …)` raises, so `math.floor` computed coordinates.

### screen (M5Stick verbs, 0–255 channels)

```lua
screen.clear([r, g, b])                       -- default black
screen.text(x, y, str[, size = 2[, r, g, b]]) -- default white
screen.fill_rect(x, y, w, h, r, g, b)    screen.rect(x, y, w, h, r, g, b)
screen.line(x0, y0, x1, y1, r, g, b)     screen.pixel(x, y, r, g, b)
screen.triangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, r, g, b)
screen.fill_triangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, r, g, b)
screen.qr(x, y, text[, scale = 4[, r, g, b]])  -- QR v3..v10, ECC low
screen.flip()   screen.set_brightness(0..255)   screen.width()   screen.height()
```

`screen` and `lgfx` draw into the same frame buffer.

### imu, buzzer, button

```lua
local ax, ay, az = imu.accel()
local gx, gy, gz = imu.gyro()
buzzer.beep(440, 200)   buzzer.tone(1000)   buzzer.stop()
button.press_count()    -- taps since the app loaded
```

### dial, trigger, ld2410 (Bench drivers)

Declare these at the top of the app (or in `init`): each declaration puts the part on the desk.
Which hardware drives a dial or trigger is the user's choice in Bench's Connections panel, so write
against the API, not a specific part: use `via` for the kind of hardware, and `connect` only when the
app is written for one particular bench.

```lua
local speed = dial.new("speed", { min = 1, max = 10, step = 1, start = 3 })
--   options: label, min, max, step, start, wrap,
--            via = "encoder" | "pot" | "imu-x" | "imu-y" | "radar" | "light" | "temperature" | "humidity",
--            connect = "pot-1:position" (one specific part and channel, as Connections names them),
--            keys = { down = "ArrowLeft", up = "ArrowRight" }
speed:value()   speed:delta()   -- steps since the last call   speed:fraction()   -- 0..1 in the range

local fire = trigger.new("fire", { key = "Space" })
--   options: label, key (a KeyboardEvent.code), connect = "button-1:press",
--            via = "button" | "external-button" | "encoder-push" | "touch" | "shake" | "presence" | "motion" | "dark"
fire:is_pressed()   fire:was_pressed()   fire:was_released()   fire:pressed_for(ms)

ld2410.begin({ mode = "wander" })   -- "wander" | "approach" | "empty" | "manual"
local r = ld2410.read()  -- { connected, moving, still, distance_cm, moving_cm, moving_energy, still_cm, still_energy, out }
```

Driver events arrive in `on_event` with `e.channel == "driver"`: `dial` `{ name, value, delta }` when a
dial moves, `trigger` `{ name, pressed }` on each edge, `presence` `{ moving, still, distance_cm }` when
the radar's state changes. Poll in `on_tick` or react to events, whichever reads better. These
modules exist only on Bench (or a board whose firmware provides them); guard with `if dial then`
for apps that should also run on a plain M5Stick.

### light, pir, climate, touch (Bench drivers)

```lua
light.read()    -- { level = 0..1, lux = 1..10000, raw = 0..4095 }   light.level()
pir.read()      -- { motion = bool }                                  pir.motion()
climate.read()  -- { temperature = °C, humidity = % }                 climate.temperature(), climate.humidity()
touch.read()    -- { touched = bool, raw = touchRead() }              touch.touched()
```

The first read puts the sensor on the user's bench if it isn't there. PIR and touch also send driver
events: `motion` `{ moving }` and `touch` `{ touched }` on each change. Prefer a `dial`/`trigger`
(`via = "light"`, `"temperature"`, `"motion"`, `"touch"` …) when the app only needs "a value" or "a
press": the user can then connect any part to it.

### touchscreen (Bench driver, displays with a touch panel)

Only on a display with a touch panel (the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.32 and
ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.91); elsewhere
`touchscreen` is nil, so check `if touchscreen then` or tag the app `-- @needs touch`. One finger,
in the coordinates the app draws in. In Bench the user taps and drags on the screen with the mouse.

```lua
local t = touchscreen.read()   -- { pressed = bool, x, y }: the last point touched
touchscreen.pressed()
-- on_event(ctx, e), e.channel == "driver", e.data = { x, y }:
--   "touch_down", "touch_move" (the newest point, at most once a loop), "touch_up",
--   "touch_tap"  after touch_up, for a release within 500 ms that moved under 10 px
```

LVGL widgets don't receive touches: hit-test your own layout.

### leds (Bench driver, LED outputs)

When the user picks an LED strip, ring or matrix as the output (instead of a display), the board
drives a WS2812B chain. Start the file with `-- @output strip` (strips and rings) or
`-- @output matrix` so it's listed for that output.

```lua
leds.count()  leds.width()  leds.height()  leds.xy(x, y)   -- LEDs from 0, chain order, a matrix row by row
leds.set(i, 0xRRGGBB)  leds.set_rgb(i, r, g, b)  leds.get(i)  leds.fill(c[, from[, count]])  leds.clear()
leds.hsv(hue_degrees, s, v) -> colour     leds.brightness(0..255)     leds.show()   -- nothing lights until show
leds.on_frame(function(ctx, dt_ms) ... end[, fps])   -- the LED driver's frame timer, default 50 fps
```

Put continuous effects in `on_frame` (on_tick is only 10 Hz). Keep brightness modest (~100): full
white is ~60 mA an LED. A matrix is also an `lgfx` display (8 pixels tall on an 8×8, the built-in
5×7 font fits), so text and shapes work with `lgfx.bind("main")` and `g:flip()`.

Plus every universal module from Resident's `prompts/sandbox.md`: `log`, `events`, `store`,
`time`, `datetime` (local zone = the browser's), `screens`.

### lvgl (optional; only on boards with LVGL)

LVGL 9 through luavgl, per Resident's `prompts/lvgl.md`. `lvgl.bind("main")` returns the display
handle and claims the panel (`lgfx` flips are then dropped: one library per panel). Fonts: the
`montserrat` family at 8, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 48 px (`lvgl.Font("montserrat", 20)`;
other sizes snap to the nearest). Put continuous motion in `lvgl.Anim`: LVGL's timer pump runs every
33 ms, `on_tick` only every 100. Bench draws `Object`, `Label`, `Button`, `Arc`, `Line`, `Led` and
`Checkbox` faithfully. `Roller` is simplified, and `Image`, `Dropdown`, `Textarea`, `Scale`, `List`,
`Keyboard` and `Calendar` are placeholder boxes, so prefer the first set. No widget receives input
events.

## Example

```lua
local g = lgfx.bind("main")
local s = screens.get("main")
local bg = s.scheme == "light" and 0xFFFFFF or 0x000000
local fg = s.scheme == "light" and 0x000000 or 0xFFFFFF
local n = 0

local function draw()
  g:fillScreen(bg)
  g:setTextColor(fg); g:setTextSize(2); g:setTextDatum(lgfx.MC_DATUM)
  g:drawString("taps " .. n, g:width() // 2, g:height() // 2)
  g:flip()
end

function init(ctx) draw() end
function on_event(ctx, e)
  if e.name == "tap" then n = n + 1; buzzer.beep(880, 40); draw() end
end
```

## Validation stubs

```lua
screen = setmetatable({
  width = function() return 240 end,
  height = function() return 135 end,
}, { __index = function() return function() end end })
imu = setmetatable({
  accel = function() return 0, 0, 1 end,
  gyro = function() return 0, 0, 0 end,
  temp = function() return 0 end,
}, { __index = function() return function() end end })
button = setmetatable({ press_count = function() return 0 end }, { __index = function() return function() end end })
local handle = setmetatable({}, { __index = function() return function() return 0 end end })
dial = { new = function() return handle end }
trigger = { new = function() return setmetatable({}, { __index = function() return function() return false end end }) end }
ld2410 = { begin = function() end, read = function()
  return { connected = true, moving = false, still = false, distance_cm = 0, moving_cm = 0, moving_energy = 0,
           still_cm = 0, still_energy = 0, out = false }
end }
buzzer = setmetatable({}, { __index = function() return function() end end })
```
